# Dotfiles repository

These rules apply only when the active repository is the dotfiles checkout. A
global symlink resolving this guidance into dotfiles does not make dotfiles
the active repository.

Treat the dotfiles repository as a small terminal profile:

- `.zshrc`: interactive Zsh; Oh My Zsh is optional.
- `.tmux.conf`: portable tmux defaults and bindings.
- `install.sh`: backs up conflicts and links managed files.
- `README.md`: setup, synchronization, and local overrides.

Exclude desktop settings, credentials, host-specific values, and generated
files. Put machine-specific shell configuration in `~/.zshrc.local`.

## Change rules

- Inspect relevant files and `git status`; preserve unrelated user changes.
- Keep changes small, portable, optional-dependency-friendly, and removable.
  Add no framework or manager unless required.
- Never commit secrets, identity data, shell history, or machine-specific
  paths.
- Preserve installer backups and fast-forward-only updates.
- Document changes to commands, dependencies, managed files, bindings, or
  local configuration.
- Keep `install.sh` POSIX `sh` with `set -eu`; quote expansions and use `--`
  before paths when supported.
- Keep `.zshrc` valid Zsh and `.tmux.conf` valid tmux configuration. Prefer
  feature detection and fallbacks.
- Use two-space shell indentation and descriptive snake_case names.
- When adding a managed file, update `managed_links` and `README.md`.
- Do not edit outside this repository during routine work or verification,
  except when the user asks to install or verify its managed files.

## Verification

Run the smallest relevant checks. For repository-wide changes:

```sh
sh -n install.sh
zsh -n .zshrc
tmux_socket="dotfiles-check-$$"
tmux -L "$tmux_socket" -f "$PWD/.tmux.conf" new-session -d
tmux -L "$tmux_socket" kill-server

test_home=$(mktemp -d)
HOME="$test_home" ./install.sh
HOME="$test_home" ./install.sh --check
```

Use only a temporary home; remove it afterward. Report unavailable checks
instead of installing tools or claiming success. For documentation-only
changes, verify structure, commands, links, and filenames.

Done means: requested behavior works; relevant checks pass or skips are
reported; user-facing documentation is current; the diff has no unrelated
changes, secrets, or generated artifacts; and the final report states the
result and verification.
